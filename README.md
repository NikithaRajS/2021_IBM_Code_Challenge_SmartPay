# SmartPay

A new Flutter payment application specially designed for students and institutions.

## Problem statement

Managing fee payments is a task that requires a lot of effort for educators and institutions. In a large institution or University, communication regarding fee payment is passed from higher authorities to lower ones and students. A student representative will collect cash from classmates. Any small mistake can lead to financial loss. A lot of paperwork and communication is required. To avoid these difficulties, we have designed and developed an application for educators and students to manage fee payments. This will eliminate a lot of manual work. Institutions can notify students instantly and generate reports automatically.
